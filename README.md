# 📁 HR Data Analysis Project

This HR analytics project focuses on understanding key workforce dynamics through data. I analyzed employee-related data to uncover insights into turnover, recruitment, and job satisfaction. The goal was to clean the dataset, calculate key HR metrics (KPIs), and deliver a clear, visual report useful for HR decision-makers.
